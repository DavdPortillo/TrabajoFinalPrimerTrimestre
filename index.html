        <div class="descripcionmiguel">
          <p class="miguelnegrita">Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni , known as Michelangelo, was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance. Born in the Republic of Florence, his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity and had a lasting influence on Western art. Michelangelo's creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas define him as an archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

            <p>Michelangelo achieved fame early; two of his best-known works, the Pietà and David, were sculpted before the age of thirty. Although he did not consider himself a painter, Michelangelo created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall.

      <h3>Edvard Munch</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="fechamiguel">12 December 1863 – 23 January 1944</div>
    <div class="descripcionmiguel">
      <p class="miguelnegrita">Was a Norwegian painter. His best known work, The Scream (1893), has become one of Western art's most iconic images.</p>
      <p>His childhood was overshadowed by illness, bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the family. Studying at the Royal School of Art and Design in Kristiania (today's Oslo), Munch began to live a bohemian life under the influence of the nihilist Hans Jæger, who urged him to paint his own emotional and psychological state ('soul painting'). From this emerged his distinctive style.</p>

        <p>Travel brought new influences and outlets. In Berlin, he met the Swedish dramatist August Strindberg, whom he painted, as he embarked on a major series of paintings he would later call The Frieze of Life, depicting a series of deeply-felt themes such as love, anxiety, jealousy and betrayal, steeped in atmosphere.

    <h3>Vincent van Gogh</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="fechamiguel">30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890</div>
  <div class="descripcionmiguel">
    <p class="miguelnegrita">Was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in Western art history. In a decade, he created about 1600 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. Not commercially successful, he struggled with severe depression and poverty, eventually leading to his suicide at age thirty-seven.</p>

      <p>Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals. After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux near Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression persisted, and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a revolver, dying from his injuries two days later.

  <div class="fechamiguel">March 28 1483 – April 6, 1520</div>
  <div class="descripcionmiguel">
    <p class="miguelnegrita">Was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur. Together with Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.</p>

      <p>Raphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his early death at 37, leaving a large body of work.
        His career falls naturally into three phases and three styles, first described by Giorgio Vasari: his early years in Umbria, then a period of about four years (1504–1508) absorbing the artistic traditions of Florence, followed by his last hectic and triumphant twelve years in Rome, working for two popes and their close associates.[7] The best known work is The School of Athens in the Vatican Stanza della Segnatura.

  <div class="fechamiguel">14 November 1840 – 5 December 1926</div>
  <div class="descripcionmiguel">
    <p class="miguelnegrita">Was a French painter and founder of impressionist painting who is seen as a key precursor to modernism, especially in his attempts to paint nature as he perceived it. The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant, exhibited in the 1874 ("exhibition of rejects") initiated by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon.</p>

      <p>Monet's ambition to document the French countryside led to a method of painting the same scene many times so as to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons. Among the best-known examples are his series of haystacks (1890–91), paintings of the Rouen Cathedral (1894), and the paintings of water lilies in his garden in Giverny that occupied him continuously for the last 20 years of his life.

          <p>Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory. The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east,[1][2][17][18] a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times,[citation needed] including The Starry Night. "Through the iron-barred window," he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, "I can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory."Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
